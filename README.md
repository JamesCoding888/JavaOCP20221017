1. <a href="https://github.com/JamesCoding888/JavaOCP20221017/tree/master/JavaOCP20221017/src/main/java/com/ocp/day3">Lesson learned of following programming with regards to String2Array and Stream's API:</a>
- Description: 

		The coming of sample codes of “StringArrayDemo(s)”, will give a guidance of reader for understanding the API of String, Array and 
		Stream (Java 1.8).

		讀者可從本節 sample code - “StringArrayDemo(s)” 中，學習如何運用 String、Array 和 Stream (Java 1.8) 的 API

> StringArraydemo.java:
- Description: 

		This program will tell you, 
		1) how to use "String[] java.lang.String.split(String regex)" for collecting the each name into String[]
		2) how to use "Arrays.toString(name_of_stringArray)"
		3) calculation of arrayLength, p.s., name_of_array.length
		4) calculation of stringLength, p.s., name_of_string.length()


> StringArraydemo2.java:
- Description: 

		This program will follow up the previously StringArraydemo.java but updated in Java 1.8

> StringArraydemo3.java:
- Description: 

		This program will give a lecture on how to use "Integer.parseInt" （which is meaning by "Parses the string argument as a signed decimal 
		integer"）to catch the score of students that are over or equal to 60, and turn into calculating their average score.
		
		此程式說明如何運用 "Integer.parseInt" (此 API 將 String 的引數轉成十進制的值)，來去抓取學生分數係大於或等於 60 分的人數，並將這些及格分數另外做總及格平均分
		數的計算

> StringArraydemo4.java:
- Description: 

		This program will follow up the previously StringArraydemo3.java but giving a differently demostration of calculation of average Score 
		(which is >= 60) in Java 1.8.
		1) mapToInt(score -> Integer.parseInt(score))
		2) filter(score -> score >= 60)
		3) average()
		4) getAsDouble()


> StringBuilderDemo.java:
- Description: 
		
		This program is giving an introduction of StringBuffer and StringBuilder.

> StringBuilderDemo2.java:
- Description: 
		
		This program gives a lecture on how to use StringBuilder Util.

> StringDemo1.java:
- Description: 


		This program will introduce how to compare with two differently String variables of their memory and value.
		1) string_name1 == string_name2
		2) string_name1.equals(string_name2)
		3) string_name1.equalsIgnoreCase(string_name2) 


> StringDemo2.java:
- Description: 


		In this code, two String objects are created: string1 and string2. string1 is created using the new keyword, which creates a new object 
		on the heap, while string2 is created using a string literal, which is stored in the string pool.

		The == operator compares the references of the two objects, and since string1 and string2 refer to different objects, the result of 
		string1 == string2 is false.
		
		The equals() method compares the contents of the two strings, so string1.equals(string2) returns true because both strings contain the 
		same characters.
		
		The intern() method is used to put a String object into the string pool, and it returns a reference to the string pool object. In the 
		code above, string1.intern() returns a reference to the string "Java" in the string pool, which is the same as string2. 
		
		Therefore, string1.intern() == string2 returns true.
		
		It's worth noting that while using intern() can be useful in certain situations, it can also have negative performance implications, so 
		it should be used judiciously.

> StringDemo3.java:
- Description: 


		The code above defines a class StringDemo3 with a main() method.

		In the main() method, a String variable message is initialized with the value " she sell sea shell on the sea shore ". 
		
		The trim() method is then called on message to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters, and the resulting string is printed 
		using println().
		
		The length() method is then called on message to get the length of the string, which is printed using printf().
		
		The substring() method is then demonstrated with two examples. 
		
		The first example uses the substring() method to extract a substring of message starting at index 9 and ending at index 12 (not 
		inclusive of the character at index 12), 
		
		which corresponds to the substring "sea". The resulting substring is printed using printf().
		
		The second example extracts each character of the String variable name by calling substring() with appropriate start and end indexes 
		for each character. 
		
		Finally, the code attempts to extract a substring starting at index 5 and ending at index 6 of name, which results in a 
		java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException 
		
		since the string is only 5 characters long and there is no character at index 5.
		
		Overall, the substring() method can be useful for extracting substrings from a String, but care must be taken to ensure that the 
		indexes are valid.

> StringDemo4.java:
- Description: 

		The program defines a class StringDemo4 with a main() method and a addUtil() method.
		
		In the main() method, a String variable language is initialized with the value "Javascrip".
	 	
	 	Then, the addUtil() method is called with language as an argument. The addUtil() method concatenates the string " to be node.js" to the 
		end of the string parameter and returns the resulting string.
		
		The main() method then prints the concatenated string using the println() method.
		
		One thing to note is that the String class in Java is immutable, which means that once a String object is created, it cannot be 
		modified. Therefore, when string += " to be node.js"; is executed in the addUtil() method, a new String object is created with the 
		concatenated value, and string is updated to refer to the new object. This means that the original String object referenced by language 
		in the main() method is not modified.
		
		
		In general, it is recommended to use a StringBuilder or StringBuffer when concatenating strings in Java, as these classes are mutable 
		and can provide better performance when performing multiple concatenations.

		Of this program, we give a lecture on converting a 2-D array (Column: 3, Row: 2) to 2-D array (Column: 2, Row: 3). 
		
		此程式介紹一組二維陣列 (列: 3, 行: 2) 的內容，轉換成 2 維陣列 (列: 2, 行: 3)。對於讀者而言，本節為了訓練陣列大小編排的邏輯概念，所設置。但在開發中，建議仍採用 
		Java 1.8 提供的 API 來做設計，因為設計者胥撰寫 for-loop 或 for-each 的迴圈架構，其迴圈的順序對於抓取陣列的位置和內容，至關重要，但對於維護上，並不是一個上
		策，假設開發者過了兩個月後，再回來閱讀程式碼時，將花上許多時間來回顧當時撰寫此程式碼的心路歷程。再者，用迴圈的撰寫方式，邏輯上較不直接 (若與 Java 1.8 的 API 相
		比)

> IntroductionOfFinal.java
- Description:  

		This Java program demonstrates the use of the final keyword in various contexts.
 	

		=================================================================
 	
		final is a non-access modifier applicable only to the following:

			1) a variable: To Create a Constant Variable, and Must be initialized

			2) a method: Prevent method Overriding

			3) a class: Prevent Inheritance

			4) final variable Must be initialized at early beginning or inside Constructor
		   
		   
 		=================================================================
 	
		關於 final 變數之用法如下:

			1) 用來宣告一個類別、函數、或者變數

			2) 類別: 當宣告在類別上時，該類別就無法被繼承！

			3) 函數: 當一個函數被宣告為 final 時，則繼承他的子類別無法覆寫

			4) final 變數，必須被初始化，其初始化之方式有兩種，一種在一開始設計變數時就給定，另一種則是在建構子中

		=================================================================

		4) Annotation of Override
		5) Application of Stream API to calculate the average age and score


> Person.java 
- Description: 

		This is a superclass called "Person" that both the "Student" and "Teacher" classes inherit from. It contains private instance variables 
		for the name and age of a person, as well as public getter and setter methods for these variables.
		
		The constructor of the Person class takes two arguments, a String name and an integer age, and initializes the corresponding instance 
		variables.
		
		The Person class also overrides the default toString() method inherited from the Object class with a custom implementation that returns 
		a string representation of the Person object.
		
		This class also notes that features like auto-boxing and unboxing, as well as the "@Override" annotation, are not supported in versions 
		of Java prior to version 1.5.
		

> Student.java 
- Description:  

		This is a Java code for a class called Student that extends the Person class. 
		



> Teacher.java 
- Description:  

		The code defines two child classes, Student and Teacher, which inherit from the parent class Person. 

		Both child classes have additional instance variables and methods specific to them.
		
		Overall, this code demonstrates the use of inheritance to define classes that share common attributes and behaviors from a parent 
		class, while also extending those classes to add specific attributes and behaviors unique to each child class.
			 


> Main.java 
- Description:  

		The code initializes objects of the Student and Teacher classes using their constructors, and then calls their toString() methods to 
		print out their attributes, 
		
		which includes their name, age, and either score or salary depending on the class. This code demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, 
		and the use of constructors and the toString() method. 
		
		The code does not demonstrate auto-boxing or the @Override annotation since it is written in Java 1.5 which does not support those 
		features.

		This lesson we give a following introduction:
		1) Inheritance
	 	2) Encapsulation
		3) Auto-boxing
		4) Annotation of Override



> Classroom.java
- Description:  

		This is a Java class named "Classroom" which is designed to manage a classroom's information including its ID, teacher, and students. 
		
		The class has several methods, including constructors with arguments, getters, and setters for the ID and teacher, as well as methods 
		
		for adding and removing students from an ArrayList object.
		
		The class also includes two methods for calculating the average score of students and the average age of the teacher and students. 
		
		The former uses Java's Stream API to retrieve the score of each student and then calculate the average, while the latter calculates the 
		average age of all students and the teacher, 
		
		depending on the number of students present.




> Main2.java 
- Description:  

		This is a Java program that demonstrates concepts of object-oriented programming such as inheritance, encapsulation, auto-boxing, 
		annotation of override, and the use of the Stream API to calculate the average age and score.
		
		This lesson we give a following introduction:
 		1) Inheritance
 		2) Encapsulation
 		3) Auto-boxing
 		4) Annotation of Override
 		5) Application of Stream API to calculate the average age and score

# day8 Java Advanced: Primitive type, Wrapper Class (including Application of Java 1.8 - Stream API), Overloading and Inheritance 
1. <a href="https://github.com/JamesCoding888/JavaOCP20221017/tree/master/JavaOCP20221017/src/main/java/com/ocp/day8">Introduction of primitive type, wrapper class, overloading and inheritance:</a>




> DemoInheritanceAndConstructors.java 
- Description:  

		In Java, a source file can only contain one public class, and the name of that class must match the name of the file. If you try to 
		create another public class with the same name in the same file, you will get a compile-time error. This is because Java uses the name 
		of the public class to identify the file and to load the class into memory when it is needed.

		It is possible to have multiple classes in a single file, but only one of them can be public. The other classes must have default 
		(package-private) access or be explicitly declared as private or protected. These classes can be used within the same package, but they 
		cannot be accessed from outside the package.
		
		一個源文件只能包含一個 public 類，且該類的名稱必須與文件名匹配。如果您嘗試在同一文件中創建另一個具有相同名稱的 public 類，則會收到編譯時錯誤。這是因為 Java 使
		用公共類的名稱來識別文件並在需要時加載類到內存中。
	  	
		在同一個文件中可以有多個類，但其中只能有一個是 public。其他類必須具有默認（包私有）訪問權限，或者明確聲明為 private 或 protected。這些類可以在同一個包 
		(package) 中使用，但無法從包外訪問。
	   	
		E.g., class Father -> public class Father  // error 



> Overloading01.java 
- Description:  


		Method overloading is a feature of Java in which a class has more than one method of the same name and their parameters are different.
		In other words, we can say that Method overloading is a concept of Java in which we can create multiple methods of the same name in the 
		same class, but type differently or length of parameters differently will decide which method will be invoked.

		Java supports method overloading through two mechanisms:

		1) By changing the data type of parameters 
		2) By changing the number of parameters

		=================================================================

		方法重載是 Java 的一個特性:
		1) 意思是一個類有多個同名方法，但帶入的型別不同 
		2) 參數長度不同，而決定要呼叫哪一個方法


> Overloading02.java 
- Description:  

 		This is a Java program that demonstrates method overloading in a food ordering scenario. 
 		
 		The program defines a class called Overloading02 that has four different methods all named menu, but with different parameter types and 
		numbers.
 		
 		此範例講述方法重載 (參數長度不同)



> PrimitiveClass.java 
- Description:  

		This lesson we introduce the Primitive type
		本節介紹基本 "基本資料型別"

		A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, 
		and it has no additional methods. 
		基本型別 (或稱原始型別) 指定變數值的大小和類型，無其它方法。

		There are eight primitive data types in Java (Java 中有八種原始資料型別):    		
		Data Type		Size			Description
		byte			1 byte			Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
		short			2 bytes			Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
		int			4 bytes			Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
		long			8 bytes			Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
		float			4 bytes			Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
		double		8 bytes			Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
		boolean		1 bit			Stores true or false values
		char			2 bytes			Stores a single character/letter or ASCII (American Standard Code for Information 
								Interchange, 美國信息交換標準編碼) values							
								Introduction of ASCII -> https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII


		<A kindly reminder>
		1) boolean: 
				The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. 
				Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. 
				This data type represents 1-bit of Size.
				There are some subtle differences between programming languages (e.g., C and Java), for your information.
				For C language, Boolean variable is stored as 16-bit (2-byte) values.

					
				boolean 資料型別，只有兩種值: true 和 false
				使用此資料型別，作為簡易偵測條件之 '真' 和 '否' 
			    	boolean 資料型別在 Java 中，只佔 1 bit 記憶體空間
			    	我們需特別注意編程語言（例如 C 和 Java）之間的一些細微差別
			    	關於 C 語言之 boolean 資料型別則佔 16-bit (2-byte) 記憶體	    	    


		2) char: 
				The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. 
			 	It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
				char 資料型別，係單個 16 位元 Unicode 字符。
			 	統一編碼的最小值為 '\u0000'（或 0），最大值為 '\uffff'（或 65,535)。



> WrapperClass1.java 
- Description:  

		This Java program demonstrates the difference between using wrapper classes in versions 1.0-1.4 and versions 1.5 and above. 
		
		In versions 1.0-1.4, there is no support for auto-boxing and unboxing, so developers must manually upcast and downcast between 
		primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes. 
		
		In versions 1.5 and above, auto-boxing and unboxing are supported, making it easier and more intuitive to work with primitive types and 
		their corresponding wrapper classes. 
		
		本程式介紹 "包覆類別"


> WrapperClass2.java 
- Description:  

 		This code demonstrates how to use the Arrays class and Stream API in Java 1.8 to work with arrays of primitive types and their 
		corresponding wrapper classes.

# day9 Java Advanced: Varargs, DAO (Data Access Object), Singleton and Polymorphism
1. <a href="https://github.com/JamesCoding888/JavaOCP20221017/tree/master/JavaOCP20221017/src/main/java/com/ocp/day9_1">Introduction the application of Varargs:</a>

		Before Java 1.5, whenever we wanted to pass an arbitrary number of arguments, we had to pass all arguments in an array or implement N 
		methods (one for each additional parameter). 
		1) public String format() { ... }
		2) public String format(String value) { ... }
		3) public String format(String value_1, String value_2) { ... }
		
		After Java 1.5, a shorthand for methods that support an arbitrary number of parameters of 
		one type was introduced, which is as follows:
		1) public String format() {String ... values}

> VarargsDemo1.java 
- Description: 

		This program we introduce the application of Varargs:
		==============================================================================================================
		Before Java 1.5, whenever we wanted to pass an arbitrary number of arguments, 
		we had to pass all arguments in an array or implement N methods (one for each additional parameter):

		1) public String format() { ... }

		2) public String format(String value) { ... }

		3) public String format(String val1, String val2) { ... }

		==============================================================================================================
		After Java 1.5 (including 1.5 version), provides a short-hand for methods that support an arbitrary number of parameters of one type
		1) public String format() {String ... values}

		==============================================================================================================
		Overall, this program provides a good example of how varargs can simplify code and allow methods to be more flexible in accepting 
		arguments.


> VarargsDemo2.java 
- Description: 

		The program above demonstrates method overloading with varargs. 
		
		There are two methods with the same name "test", but one takes an arbitrary number of int arguments and the other takes two int 
		arguments.
		
		本程式設計相同的方法名稱，但不同的參數	

> VarargsDemo3.java 
- Description: 	

		This program we design a method with one fixed argument  
		but support an arbitrary number of parameters of one type (i.e., int) for another

		本程式設計一個方法，其中一個固定的輸入參數為 int 型別，另外一個則是可變參數

2. <a href="https://github.com/JamesCoding888/JavaOCP20221017/tree/master/JavaOCP20221017/src/main/java/com/ocp/day9_1">Introduction the application of DAO and Singleton:</a>
> Dao.java 
- Description: 

		The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is a structural pattern that allows us to isolate the application/business layer from the 
		persistence layer (usually a relational database but could be any other persistence mechanism) using an "abstract API". Regarding the 
		information above, it's at very beginning moment for you, since we do NOT include any "abstract API" during this lesson. But, no worry, 
		we will review this topic at the following later day. 

> SingleDao.java 
- Description: 

		This program you wil learn how to design Singleton pattern.
		To create a singleton-class, this class must implement the following properties:
		1) Create a private constructor of the class to restrict object created outside of the singleton-class.
		2) Create a private attribute (eg., "private static SingleDao SingleDao_Instance = new SingleDao()") of the class type that refers to 
		   the single  object.
		3) Create a public static method (eg., "public static SingleDao getSingleDaoInstance()") that allows us to create and access the object 
		   we created.  Inside the method, we will create a condition that prohibits us from creating more than one object.

		What's this mean by, "allows us to create and access the object we created" ? It's likely you share a Single Global Instance and 
		provide a Global Point of Access to SingleDao.class.
	  
> UserDao.java 
- Description: 

		This UserDaoclass is implementing the Dao.class and SingleDao.class
		
		A kindly Reminder: 
		(1) You may get a different Console message from the annotation of this UserDao.java, because the programming of generating value of 
		id_number from "Dao.java" is via "new Random().nextInt()"
		
		Of the "SingleDao.java", we design a Singleton pattern into this class, and you will see the generated id_number is SAME!

		(2) Since we created a public static method (i.e., "public static SingleDao getSingleDaoInstance()") to prohibit developer from 
		creating more than one object for accessing the inside object of "SingleDao.java".
	
3. <a href="https://github.com/JamesCoding888/JavaOCP20221017/tree/master/JavaOCP20221017/src/main/java/com/ocp/day9_2">Introduction the application of Polymorphism_1:</a>

		Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), along with encapsulation, inheritance, and 
		abstraction. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of a common superclass or interface, 
		providing flexibility and reusability in code.

		In OOP, Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. 
		Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This 
		allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

		One of the most common examples of polymorphism is method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that 
		is already defined in its superclass. This allows objects of the subclass to be used in place of objects of the superclass, without 
		requiring any changes to the code that uses them.

		Another example of polymorphism is method overloading, where a class provides multiple methods with the same name but different 
		parameters. This allows the same method name to be used for different purposes, based on the types of the arguments passed to it.

		In Java, polymorphism is achieved through the use of inheritance, interfaces, and dynamic method dispatch. Dynamic method dispatch is a 
		mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, rather than at compile time. This allows the method to be 
		invoked on objects of different classes, based on the type of the object at runtime.


> TestPolymorphismOfAnimal.java, Cat.java, Lion.java, Cow.java, Horse.java, Feet.java 
- Description: 

		Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

		Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This 
		allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

		For example, think of a super-class called Cat that has a method called animalSound(). Sub-classes of Animals could be Lion...etc - And 
		they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the Lion "roar", etc.)


		The following the structures of Polymorphism are:


			Super-class:	Cat       Feet     Feet

					 ^	   ^        ^
					 |	   |        |

			Sub-class:	Lion	   Cow     Horse

- This lesson you will learn a roughly design of different positions at company and some variables/methods only for specific position


> Employee.java 
- Description: 
		
 		This is an example of a Java class named "Employee", 
 		
 		which serves as a superclass (or parent class) for other classes that inherit its properties and methods.
 		
 		Overall, this class provides a basic template that can be used to create more specific classes for different types of employees within 
		the company. 
 		
 		By inheriting from this superclass, these classes will have access to its properties and methods, and can override them or add new ones 
		as needed.


> Manager.java 
- Description: 


		This is an example of a Java subclass named "Manager" that extends the "Employee" superclass. 
		
		The "Manager" class has its own instance variable named "budget", which is assigned a value of 100,000. 
		
		This variable represents the budget that is allocated for the manager to use in their role.


> Supervisor.java 
- Description: 

		This is an example of another Java subclass named "Supervisor" that also extends the "Employee" superclass. 
		
		The "Supervisor" class has its own instance variable named "stock_option", 
		
		which represents the employee stock option (ESO) granted to the supervisor as part of their compensation package. 
		
		The variable is assigned a value of 120,000. 


> Test01.java 
- Description: 

		This is an example of a nested cast, where the "supervisor" instance is first cast to its superclass "Employee", and then to the 
		"Manager" subclass. 
		
		However, this cast will result in a runtime exception "java.lang.ClassCastException", because the "Supervisor" class cannot be cast to 
		the "Manager" class, as they are unrelated subclasses.

> Test02.java 
- Description: 

		The code attempts to access various instance variables from each of these instances, and print them to the console.
	
		The "salary" instance variable is accessed for each instance, which is inherited from the "Employee" superclass, so it is present in 
		all three instances.

		For the "manager" and "supervisor" instances, the code attempts to access the "budget" and "stock_option" instance variables, 
		respectively, 
		
		which are not present in the "Employee" superclass. This will result in a compiler error, because the variable is not defined in the 
		superclass, and is specific to the subclass.
		

> Test03.java 
- Description: 

		Invoke the method of jobDescription from object of employee, manager and supervisor, to get the value of job description.

> Test04.java 
- Description: 

		The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).

		The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. 

		Notice:
			1) It returns either true or false. 
			2) If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, 
			   it returns false.

> Test05.java 
- Description: 

		The Test05 class takes an instance of the Employee, Manager, and Supervisor classes as input and calls the printBudget method with each 
		of them as arguments. 
		
		The printBudget method takes an Employee object as an argument and checks whether it is an instance of Manager or Supervisor. 
		
		If it is an instance of Manager, it downcasts the Employee object to Manager and prints out the value of the budget variable from the 
		Manager class. 
		
		If it is an instance of Supervisor, it downcasts the Employee object to Supervisor and prints out the value of the stock_option 
		variable from the Supervisor class.
		
		Overall, the Test05 class is an example of how to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class or subclass, 
		
		and how to downcast an object to a subclass to access its variables or methods.		 





------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# day10 Java Advanced: Abstract and Interface
1. Introduction of abstract:


		1) Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces
		2) The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
		3) Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
		4) Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited 
		   from).

2. Introduction of interface:

		1) Another way to achieve abstract
		2) interface method (does not have a body), the body is provided by the "implement" class
		3) To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" by another class with the "implements" keyword (instead of 
		   "extends")
		4) On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
		5) Interface attributes are by "public static final"
		6) An interface CANNOT contain a constructor (that is, interface cannot be used to create objects)
		7) An interface doesn't have any memory space of its own. It is just a blueprint or a contract that defines a set of methods that must 
		   be implemented by a class that implements the interface. 
		   When a class implements an interface, it provides the actual implementation for the methods defined in the interface, and it is the 
		   object of that class that will have memory space allocat	
	

		Why And When To Use Interfaces?
		1) For security - we can hide certain details and only show the important details of an object (interface).
		2) Java does not support "multiple inheritance" (i.e., a class can only inherit from one superclass, e.g., A extends B). However, 
		   interface can be achieved with interfaces, since the class can implement multiple interfaces, e.g., A implements B, C, D

4. <a href="https://github.com/JamesCoding888/JavaOCP20221017/tree/master/JavaOCP20221017/src/main/java/com/ocp/day10_1">The following sample code for your information of relationship between abstract and interface:</a>
> InterfaceAnimal.java
- Description: 

		Introduction of this program:
			1) In the given code snippet, we have an interface called InterfaceAnimal. It declares three abstract methods eat(), play(), 
			   and name(). 
			   These methods don't have any implementation and will be implemented by any class that implements this interface.
			2) The interface also has a constant COPY_RIGHT declared as public static final String COPY_RIGHT = "Discovery.com". 
			   It means that any class implementing this interface will have access to this constant.

			3) The interface also has a default method copyRight() declared as default void copyRight() { ... }. 
			   It means that any class implementing this interface will have this method with a default implementation that prints the 
			   value of COPY_RIGHT.

			4) An interface cannot have a constructor. This is because an interface is not a class and cannot be instantiated, 
			   so it doesn't make sense to have a constructor in an interface.

# day11 Java Advanced: The Decorator and Observer's Pattern
Decorator Pattern (A menu of Subway Order System):
- We design a Scanner object for customer to choose three fixed option of bread (i.e., Wheat, Honey Oat, or Italian and Parmesan Oregano). 
- Firstly, you will see the many different initiated objects from o1 to o11. Please read the line at 40 and 48-57. 
- Each of initiated object will be the argument of the next Constructor. It's likely all of them are wrapped up as decoration of furniture at house. 
- For an instance of your house, you may need a big door, chairs, a oval table, a set of sofa, two Televisions, and many bulbs...etc. Those of furniture of house, it seems that you can add or remove whenever you want. For this said, we create a sample code of Subway Order System. You could choose what kind of bread you need, and also what flavors you would like to decorate into the bread. 
- Just in case, you like to remove one of flavors (e.g., egg), then make an annotation of object of Egg.
- By the way, if you forgot how operation of Scanner and nextLine() could be, please refer to the previously package at com.ocp.day6.ScannerPractice

1. The decorator pattern as following SubwayUML below:

	<img width="203" alt="SubwayUML" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83496093/210288800-2d7092ac-040c-4a44-8c7a-404ae920af10.png">

> Food.java
- Description: 

		The global variable of "name" and "price", we place here in the Food.class, for implement by subclass. Also, there are two methods 
		given by abstraction, because these methods without body (so-called virtual method) are, developer expected them to be implemented. 


> AgentOfFood.java
- Description: 

		For a purpose of designing the abstraction class here, please imagine that your project (e.g., Menu of Order System) is almost to be 
		DONE, but suddenly your client request additional function which could query the flavors and price of meal. Engineer is NOT willing to 
		update the original structure of programming because the mostly is settled. Hereinafter, you could design an abstraction class (i.e., 
		AgentOfFood.class) to create a function that client required to.  

		Any reason of solution we choose, is abstraction class? Since cannot initiate the object of abstraction class by itself, we need the 
		subclass of abstraction class to invoke the variable/method of abstraction class.
		And therefore, we could avoid the original structure of programming from updating, but merely have subclass inherit the abstraction 
		class (i.e., AgentOfFood).	

		For the sake of designing an abstraction class, you may have many requirements from different clients, then you merely manage the 
		package of abstraction class without any impact on the original design.

		設計此抽象類別之用意，請讀者想像一個情境，假設您目前執行的專案為『點餐訂單系統』且已接近完工，卻接到客戶要求，需在訂單系統中增加一個功能 (可查詢顧客點的餐點配菜和
		餐點價格)，但基於程式架構已完成，工程師為了不影響訂單系統的程式架構，這時可使用抽象類別 (也就是本程式中的 AgentOfFood.class) 來設計。
		那為什麼選用抽象類別，因為抽象類別無法將物件實體化，也就是不可從任意類別中，使用 new AgentOfFood()，其原因是，抽象類別係為了由子類別實體化的物件，來呼叫抽象類
		別中的變數或方法，如此，可避免設計者去修改既有程式碼的商業邏輯，而僅僅只需讓底層的類別去繼承抽象類別，這樣既保有原來的架構，後期在維護上也能因應不同的客戶之需求，
		建立其它的抽象類別之功能。最後設計者只需管理抽象類別包，都不需動到底層的架構

	<img width="203" alt="ObserverUML" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83496093/206376348-f554bbc5-910a-4c9f-8bbd-50f1a249f2a8.png">




	
> Observer.java
- Description:  

		This is the definition of a Java interface called Observer.

		The interface has a single method called update, which takes a String parameter named message. 

		The method does not have an implementation because interfaces only define the method signature but not the implementation.

		Any class that implements this interface will be required to provide its own implementation of the update method. 

		The purpose of this interface is to define a common contract for classes that need to observe and react to changes in a system or data.

> Subject.java
- Description:  
	
		This is the definition of a Java interface called Subject.
	
		The interface defines three methods: add, remove, and notifyObserver. All three methods are declared without implementation because 
		this is an interface.
	 
			1. add method:

				The add method takes an object that implements the Observer interface as a parameter, and its purpose is to add the 
				observer to the list of observers that the subject will notify when a change occurs.

			2. remove method:

				The remove method takes an object that implements the Observer interface as a parameter, and its purpose is to remove 
				the observer from the list of observers that the subject will notify when a change occurs.
				
			3. notifyObserver method:

				The notifyObserver method takes a String parameter named message. Its purpose is to notify all the observers that a 
				change has occurred by calling the update method on each observer and passing the message parameter.

		By defining this interface, any class that needs to act as a subject in the observer pattern can implement this interface and provide 
		its own implementation of these three methods.



> NewsTopic.java
- Description:  

		This is a Java class called NewsTopic that implements the Subject interface.

		The class has a private field called collectElementsFromObserver that is a List of Observer objects. This list is used to manage the 
		observers that are interested in receiving notifications from the subject.

		The class provides implementations for the three methods defined in the Subject interface.

			1. add method:

			   The add method adds an Observer object to the list of observers managed by the subject.

			2. remove method:

			   The remove method removes an Observer object from the list of observers managed by the subject.


			3. notifyObserver method:

			   The notifyObserver method notifies all the observers in the list by calling the update method on each observer and passing 
			   the message parameter.

		By implementing the Subject interface, this class can act as a subject in the observer pattern, and other classes can register 
		themselves as observers by calling the add method. When a change occurs, the subject can notify all the registered observers by calling 
		the notifyObserver method. The observers will receive the notification and can take appropriate actions based on the information 
		provided in the message parameter.

> Recipient.java
- Description:  

		This is a Java class called Recipient that implements the Observer interface.

		By implementing the Observer interface, this class can act as an observer in the observer pattern.

		The class has a private field called name that represents the name of the recipient.

		The class provides an implementation for the update method defined in the Observer interface.

		1. update method:

		   The update method takes a String parameter named message, which represents the message sent by the subject. 

		   The method simply prints a message to the console indicating that the recipient has received the message and displays the name of 
		   the recipient and the message itself.

		   When a change occurs in the subject, the update method will be called on each registered observer, including instances of this 
		   class. 

		   In the update method, the recipient can take appropriate actions based on the information provided in the message parameter.

> RecipientCommunication.java
- Description:  

		This is a Java class called RecipientCommunication that demonstrates the use of the observer pattern using the NewsTopic and Recipient 
		classes.

		In this example, each recipient is added to the list of observers managed by the subject, and then removed after receiving a 
		notification. 

		This demonstrates the dynamic nature of the observer pattern, where observers can be added and removed as needed, depending on the 
		requirements of the application.

# day11 Java Advanced: Equals & HashCode 
1. Introduction of how to improve the hashCode() Implementation could be, as following sample codes with overriding the method of<a href="https://github.com/JamesCoding888/JavaOCP20221017/tree/master/JavaOCP20221017/src/main/java/com/ocp/day11_2"> "public int hashCode(){ ... }" </a> to avoid "Hash Collision" from two different objects being equally.


2. Sincerely recommended a Book for your reference - "Effective Java 3rd Edition". You will be even better to understand the "Hash Collision" and "hashCode algorithm".
Link -> "https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997" 	
 	

> EqualsFunction.java
- Description:  

		The code we provided demonstrates the usage of the equals() method and the hashCode() method in Java.

		It's important to note that the hash code calculation and the possibility of hash collisions may vary depending on the Java Virtual 
		Machine (JVM) version and implementation. 

		The behavior described in the comments is specific to the execution environment using Java-11 with JRE 16.0.1. 


> EqualsHashCode.java, OverrideEqualsHashCodeFunction.java
- Description: 

		The method of "public int hashCode(){ ... }" being overrided with the value of prime: 31, was chosen because it is an odd prime. 
		If it were even and the multiplication overflowed, information would be lost, because multiplication by 2 is equivalent to shifting. 
		The advantage of using a prime is less clear, but it is traditional. A nice property of 31 is that the multiplication can be replaced 
		by a shift and a subtraction for better performance on some architectures: 31 * i == (i << 5) - i. Modern VMs do this sort of 
		optimization automatically. Reference of "Effective Java (3rd Edition), Joshua Bloch

# day12 Java Advanced: Outer Class, Inner Class and Anonymous
1. <a href="https://github.com/JamesCoding888/JavaOCP20221017/tree/master/JavaOCP20221017/src/main/java/com/ocp/day12/InnerClass/innerclass">Introduction of Inner class</a>

		============================================================================================================================= 
		Rules of Local Inner Class:

		1) The scope of the local inner class is indeed restricted to the block they are defined in. 
		   It means that the class can only be accessed and used within the block of code where it is defined.

		2) A local inner class cannot be instantiated from outside the block where it is created in.
		   For an example of following: 	

				OuterClassA {

					new InnerClassB(); // Unallowable  

					InnerClassB {

					}
				}

		3) Prior to JDK 8, local inner classes could only access the final local variables of the enclosing block. 
		   However, starting from JDK 8, they can also access non-final local variables. 
		   This allows more flexibility in using local variables within the inner class.

		4) A local class (inner class) has access to the members of its enclosing class. 
		   In the given example, the InnerCardOwner class has access to the private serialNumber field of the Outer class.

		5) Local inner classes can extend an abstract class or implement an interface. 
		   This enables the inner class to inherit or implement behavior defined in the abstract class or interface.
		=============================================================================================================================
		區域內部類別之規定：

		1) 區域內部類別的範圍限定在其所定義的區塊內。這意味著該類別只能在定義它的程式碼區塊內部被存取和使用。

		2) 區域內部類別不能從創建它的區塊外部實例化。在提供的例子中，試圖在 OuterClassA 區塊之外創建 InnerClassB 的實例是不允許的。
		   例如:
				OuterClassA {

					new InnerClassB(); // Unallowable  

					InnerClassB {

					}
				}

		 3) 在 JDK 8 之前，區域內部類別只能存取封閉區塊的 final 區域變數。
		    然而，從 JDK 8 開始，它們還可以存取非 final 區域變數。這樣可以更靈活地在內部類別中使用區域變數。

		 4) 區域類別（內部類別）可以調用其封閉類別的成員 (變數/方法)。
		    在給定的例子中，InnerCardOwner 類別可以存取 Outer 類別的私有 serialNumber 欄位。

		 5) 區域內部類別可繼承 "抽象類別" 或 "實作介面"。
		    這使得內部類別可以繼承或實作在抽象類別或介面中定義的行為。

> ListEfficiency.java
- Description: 

		The code we provided compares the performance of two approaches: 

			Reusing the same List object and creating a new List object in each iteration of the loop. 

			The code measures the time it takes to add 1,000,000 strings to the list for each approach and calculates the average duration over 100 iterations.


		When reusing the same List object:

			The list is cleared before each iteration using list.clear().
			The memory allocated for the list remains the same throughout the loop.

		When creating a new List object in each iteration:

			A new List object is created for each iteration.
			The memory allocated for the previous List object is released and garbage collected.

		In terms of performance, creating a new List object in each iteration may provide better memory management as the memory is released and garbage collected after each 
		iteration. 
		However, this approach incurs the overhead of creating a new List object repeatedly.

		To accurately determine which approach is faster, it is recommended to perform benchmarking and testing in your specific environment and use case. 
		The actual performance may vary depending on factors such as JVM implementation, memory management, and hardware.		

> EfficiencyLab4Collection.java
- Description: 		
		
		The subject of this code is to compare the efficiency of different collection classes in Java. 

		It measures the time taken to perform 1,000,000 data operations (adding elements) on various collection classes and presents the results in ascending order based on 
		the average duration. 

		The code aims to provide insights into the performance characteristics of different collection classes, allowing developers to make informed decisions when choosing 
		the appropriate collection class for their specific requirements.
		
		Based on the implementation of the code, the console output appears to display the average durations (in seconds) for each collection class in ascending order. 
		It suggests that the TreeSet class has the lowest average duration, indicating better performance compared to the other classes.

			1) The Hashtable class is the oldest implementation of a hash table data structure in Java.

			2) Hashtable<K, V> class, at package: "java.util", is a subclass of Map interface, 
			   which means it implements the Map interface and provides the functionality of a key-value mapping.

			3) Hashtable is specifically designed as a hashtable-based implementation of the Map interface. 

			4) Hashtable stores data in the form of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a corresponding value.

			5) Hashtable does not allow null values or null keys. Attempting to store null values or null keys will result in an exception.

			6) Hashtable utilizes a hash table data structure, where keys are mapped to specific indices in an underlying array using a hash function.

			7) When attempting to insert a key-value pair with a duplicate key, Hashtable will replace the existing value associated with that key.

			8) Hashtable is synchronized, meaning it is designed to be thread-safe for concurrent access. On the other hand, HashMap is not synchronized by default.

			9) Hashtable provides fail-fast iteration. If a collection is modified while being iterated, a ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown. 

		   	10) Hashtable provides an Enumeration interface for iterating over its elements. However, HashMap does not provide a specific Enumeration interface.

		   	11) Hashtable does not guarantee any specific order of the key-value pairs in the map. The order may vary, and it is not guaranteed to remain constant over time.

		   	12) Hashtable implements fail-fast iteration. This means that if a collection is modified while being iterated, a ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown.  

		   	13) The Hashtable class was indeed introduced in Java 1.0, which was released in 1996.

		Refer to the link as follows:
		https://www.baeldung.com/java-hash-table
		https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html

	<br>	 

		The code demonstrates the usage of a Hashtable in Java. 

		It initializes a Hashtable with a default initial capacity of 11 and a load factor of 0.75. 

		Then, it adds key-value pairs to the Hashtable using the put() method. 

		If a duplicate key is inserted, the Hashtable will replace the existing value associated with that key.

		Also the code attempts to add a null key and a null value to the Hashtable, which would result in a NullPointerException. 

		It's important to avoid storing null keys or null values in a Hashtable.

		The code also demonstrates the usage of the elements() method, which returns an Enumeration of the values in the Hashtable. 

		It iterates over the elements using the hasMoreElements() and nextElement() methods of the Enumeration, printing each value. 
	


> FailFastIterationExample.java
- Description:  

		Introduction of this example:

			We have a list called names containing three elements. 

			We obtain an iterator from the list using the iterator() method. 

			Then, we enter a loop to iterate over the elements using the hasNext() and next() methods of the iterator.

			Inside the loop, we print each name and intentionally modify the list by adding a new element ("David") while iterating. 

			This modification violates the fail-fast behavior, as the list is structurally modified during iteration.

		Exception:

			When you run this code, it will throw a ConcurrentModificationException because the list was modified while being iterated. 

			This exception serves as a fail-fast mechanism, alerting you to the concurrent modification and preventing potential data inconsistencies.

		Avoid ConcurrentModificationException:

			To avoid the ConcurrentModificationException in this scenario, you can use proper synchronization or utilize concurrent collection classes like 
			ConcurrentHashMap or CopyOnWriteArrayList, which are specifically designed to handle concurrent modifications safely.

> HashMapDemo1.java
- Description:  

		Introduction of HashMap:

			1) HashMap<K, V> class, is indeed a class in the "java.util" package and is a subclass of Map interface.  

			2) HashMap stores data as key-value pairs.

			3) HashMap allows both null values and null keys.

			4) When inserting a key-value pair with a duplicate key, HashMap will replace the existing value with the new one.

			6) HashMap is unsynchronized (not thread-safe), while Hashtable is synchronized (thread-safe).

			7) HashMap allows null values and keys, whereas Hashtable does not.

			8) HashMap does not guarantee the order of the map. The iteration order can change over time due to various factors.

		    	9) HashMap provides fail-fast iteration, which means that if the map is modified while iterating over it, it will throw a ConcurrentModificationException to 
		    	indicate the structural modification.   	    	   

		      10) This implementation of Map, provides constant-time performance for the basic operations (get and put), 
		       assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets. 

			   Please see the following demo code of initiated instance of hashMap and basic operations of "get" and "put".

				**********************************************************
				*	Map<Object, Object> hashMap = new HashMap<>();   *
				*	hashMap.put(1 , "A123456789");			 *
				*	hashMap.put(2 , "H123546789");			 *
				*	hashMap.put(3 , "B123546879");			 *
				*	System.out.println(hashMap);			 *	
				*	System.out.println(hashMap.get(1));	         *
				*	System.out.println(hashMap.get(2));		 *
				*	System.out.println(hashMap.get(3));		 *
				**********************************************************
				*	Console: 					 *
				*	   {1=A123456789, 2=H123546789, 3=B123546879}    *
				*          A123456789					 *
				*	   H123546789					 *
				*	   B123546879					 *
				**********************************************************

		      11) The HashMap class was introduced in Java 1.2, which was released in 1998.


		Load Factor & Initial Capacity:	

			    1) Iteration over collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the HashMap instance (the number of buckets) 
			       plus its size (the number of key-value mappings).

			    2) It's very IMPORTANT NOT to set the "initial capacity" too high or the "load factor" too low if iteration PERFORMANCE is IMPORTANT.
				An instance of HashMap has two variables that affect its performance: 

			       (1) Initial Capacity:
				   The capacity is the number of buckets in the "hash table", and the initial capacity is simply the capacity at the time the "hash table" is created.

			       (2) Load Factor:
				   The load factor is a Measure of how full the "hash table" is Allowed to Get before its capacity is automatically increased. 
				   When the number of entries in the "hash table" EXCEEDS the product of the load factor and the current capacity, 
				   the hash table is "rehashed" (that is, internal data structures are rebuilt) so that the "hash table" has approximately Twice the number of 
				   buckets.


			    3) As a general rule speaking:

			       (1) The default load factor (.75) offers a Good TradeOff between Time and Space Costs (Hard Disk / SSD). 
				   
			       (2) Higher value of load factor decreases the space overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of the operations of the HashMap class, 
				   including get and put). 
			           The expected number of entries in the map and its load factor should be taken into account when setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize 
				   the number of rehash operations. 
				   
			       (3) If the initial capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash operations will ever occur.

			       (4) If many mappings are to be stored in a HashMap instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow the mappings to be stored 
				   more efficiently than letting it perform automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table. 

			       (5) Note that using many keys with the same hashCode() is a sure way to Slow Down Performance of any hash table. To improve impact, when keys are 
				   Comparable, this class may use comparison order among keys to help break ties.

> LinkedHashMapDemo.java
- Description:  


		Overview of LinkedHashMap:

			1) LinkedHashMap is a class in the Java programming language that extends the HashMap class. 

			   E.g.,
					public class LinkedHashMap<K,V> extends HashMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V>  

			2) LinkedHashMap maintains a doubly-linked list of the entries in the map in the order in which they were inserted. 
			   This allows the elements to be accessed in the order they were added to the map.

			3) The aspects of LinkedHashMap is generally like HashMap. 
			   But, LinkedHashMap provides additional methods and constructors to support the ordering of the elements. 

			   For an instance, LinkedHashMap provides a constructor that allows you to specify the initial capacity of the map 
			   and whether it should maintain the order of insertion.

				   public LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor, boolean accessOrder) {
					super(initialCapacity, loadFactor);
					this.accessOrder = accessOrder;
			           }

				   initialCapacity: 

						The initial capacity of the map. This is the number of buckets that the map can hold initially. The default value is 16.

				   loadFactor: 

						The load factor of the map. This is the maximum ratio of entries to buckets before the map is resized. The default value is 0.75.

				   accessOrder: 

						If true, the order of iteration is the order of access (from least-recently accessed to most-recently accessed). 
						If false, the iteration order is the order in which the entries were inserted. The default value is false.

			4) Load Factor and Initial Capacity are defined precisely as for HashMap. However, that the penalty for 
			   choosing an excessively high value for initial capacity is less severe for LinkedHashMap than for HashMap, 
			   as iteration times for this class are unaffected by capacity.


			5) The element(s) of LinkedHashMap is iteration guaranteed

			6) Repeated element(s) NOT allowable

			7) Null key allowable

			8) LinkedHashMap implementation is NOT synchronized. 
			   If you are trying to access it from multiple threads and at least one of these threads is likely to change it structurally, 
			   then it MUST be externally synchronized.

			   Best to do this at creation for synchronization:

					Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new LinkedHashMap());
			   
			   For the detail explanation, see class of 'LinkedHashMapWithSynchronizedMap'
			   
			9) The constant-time performance of LinkedHashMap is likely to be a little worse than the constant-time of HashMap due to the added overhead of maintaining a 
			   doubly-linked list.
			   Iteration over collection views of LinkedHashMap also takes linear time O(n) similar to that of HashMap. 
			   On the flip side, LinkedHashMap‘s linear time performance during iteration is better than HashMap‘s linear time.
			   This is because, for LinkedHashMap, n in O(n) is only the number of entries in the map regardless of the capacity. Whereas, for HashMap, n is capacity and 
			   the size summed up, O(size+capacity).

			   For the detail explanation, see class of 'LinkedHashMapAndHashMapEfficiency'

		       10) The LinkedHashMap class was introduced in Java 1.4, which was released in 2002.

> LinkedHashMapWithSynchronizedMap.java
- Description:

		The sample code demonstrating statements 8):

			The code demonstration creates a synchronized version of a LinkedHashMap using Collections.synchronizedMap(). 

			The code then perform operations (adding elements) on the synchronized map from multiple threads. 

			To ensure thread safety, the code synchronizes the map using synchronized (synchronizedMap) before accessing or modifying it.
	

> LinkedHashMapAndHashMapEfficiency.java
- Description:

		Let's break it down and explain it in detail of statement 9):

			1. For LinkedHashMap:

			   The time complexity for iterating over the collection view of a LinkedHashMap is linear, denoted as O(n).
			   Here, 'n' represents the number of entries in the map, which means it depends solely on the size of the LinkedHashMap and is independent of the initial 
			   capacity.
			   Regardless of the capacity of the LinkedHashMap, the iteration time is determined only by the number of entries present.

			2. For HashMap:

			   The time complexity for iterating over the collection view of a HashMap is also linear, denoted as O(n).
			   However, in the case of HashMap, 'n' represents the sum of the size of the map and the initial capacity.
			   In HashMap, the iteration time is influenced by both the size of the map and the initial capacity, which affects the total number of entries that need to be 
			   processed during iteration.

			3. To summarize:

			   LinkedHashMap's iteration time is solely based on the number of entries in the map and is independent of the capacity. 
			   This makes LinkedHashMap more efficient for iteration compared to HashMap when the number of entries is large but the capacity is relatively small.

			   HashMap's iteration time depends on both the size of the map and the initial capacity. 
			   This means that HashMap's iteration performance can be impacted by a larger initial capacity, resulting in a longer iteration time compared to 
			   LinkedHashMap.

			   It's important to note that these performance differences may vary based on the specific use case, the size of the map, and the specific implementation of 
			   the JVM. 
			   Therefore, it's always recommended to benchmark and profile the code to evaluate the actual performance characteristics in a given scenario.


		The sample code demonstrating statements 9):   

			The given code is comparing the execution time and iteration time of LinkedHashMap and HashMap for adding elements and iterating over the elements.

			In the code, the number of elements to add is set to numElements = 100. The execution time and iteration time are measured in nanoseconds.

		Here are the results of running the code with numElements = 1000000 and numElements = 100:

			1. For numElements = 1000000:

				LinkedHashMap execution time (adding elements): 254905292 nanoseconds
				HashMap execution time (adding elements): 194495166 nanoseconds

				LinkedHashMap iteration time: 14460583 nanoseconds
				HashMap iteration time: 26360292 nanoseconds

			2. For numElements = 100:

				LinkedHashMap execution time (adding elements): 1998791 nanoseconds
				HashMap execution time (adding elements): 198208 nanoseconds

				LinkedHashMap iteration time: 900083 nanoseconds
				HashMap iteration time: 11958 nanoseconds



		Based on the results, here are some observations:

			1. Adding Elements: 

				The execution time for adding elements is generally higher for LinkedHashMap compared to HashMap. This can be attributed to the additional 
				overhead in maintaining the insertion order of elements in LinkedHashMap.

			2. Iteration Time: 

				The iteration time for both LinkedHashMap and HashMap is relatively faster compared to adding elements. In both cases, iterating over the 
				elements is efficient. However, the iteration time for LinkedHashMap is slightly higher compared to HashMap due to the need to maintain the 
				insertion order.

			3. Overall: 
				
				The choice between LinkedHashMap and HashMap depends on your specific requirements. If you need to maintain the insertion order of elements, 
			   	LinkedHashMap is a suitable choice despite the slightly higher execution and iteration time. If insertion order is not a concern, HashMap can provide 
				faster execution and iteration time.

> TreeMapDemoComparable.java, Student.java, Exam.java
- Description: 
		
		Introduction of this lesson: 

			1) The constructor of the TreeMap class: 

					public class TreeMap<K,V>{

					     * Constructs a new, empty tree map, using the natural ordering of its
					     * keys.  All keys inserted into the map must implement the {@link
					     * Comparable} interface.  Furthermore, all such keys must be
					     * <em>mutually comparable</em>: {@code k1.compareTo(k2)} must not throw
					     * a {@code ClassCastException} for any keys {@code k1} and
					     * {@code k2} in the map.  If the user attempts to put a key into the
					     * map that violates this constraint (for example, the user attempts to
					     * put a string key into a map whose keys are integers), the
					     * {@code put(Object key, Object value)} call will throw a
					     * {@code ClassCastException}.

						   public TreeMap() {
						       comparator = null;
						   }
					}


			   Explanation:

					This constructor initializes a new instance of TreeMap with the natural ordering of its keys. 
					It sets the comparator field to null, indicating that the natural ordering of the keys will be used for 
					sorting.

					By default, when no explicit Comparator is provided during the construction of a TreeMap object, it 
					uses the natural ordering of the keys. 
					This means that the key objects inserted into the TreeMap must implement the Comparable interface and 
					provide their own implementation of the compareTo method to determine their ordering.

					If you want to specify a custom comparator for sorting the keys in the TreeMap, you can use the 
					constructor that accepts a Comparator parameter. (see sample code of TreeMapDemoComparator class)

			2) A TreeMap is a Map implementation that maintains its "keys" in ASCENDING order, sorted according to the natural 
			3) ordering of its keys or according to a Comparator provided at TreeMap creation time. 


			3) TreeMap sorts its all entries in natural ordering of the keys, by default. 
				- For example of entries in type of Integer, the natural order will be ASCENDING order.
				- For the entries in type of String, the natural order will be Alphabetical order.

			4) TreeMap is implemented using a Red-Black tree data structure and provides the NavigableMap interface.


			5) Red-black tree is a data structure that consists of nodes. For the detail information, please see the following link
			   https://www.baeldung.com/cs/red-black-trees

			6) Here is an animation of Red-Black tree for your reference:
			   https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html


			7) If the keys in TreeMap cannot be sorted based on their natural order, 
			   the developer can provide a custom 'Comparator' or make the key objects implement the 'Comparable' interface to 
			   define the order.		   		   		   		

			8) TreeMap does not allow null keys because the comparison methods used for sorting, such as compareTo() or compare(), 
			   would throw a NullPointerException if a null key is used.


			9) Pros 
					- Provides log(n) time cost for the get, put, and remove operations.
					- Offers the advantage of maintaining the elements in a sorted order.
					- TreeMap can save memory (in comparison to HashMap) because it only uses the amount of memory needed 
					  to hold its items, unlike a HashMap which uses a contiguous region of memory.

			10) Cons
					- Generally performance is slower than HashMap and LinkedHashMap.
					- A tree should maintain its balance to keep its intended performance, which requires a considerable 
					  amount of effort, complicating the implementation.
					- Since a TreeMap has more significant locality, we might consider it if we want to access objects that 
					  are relatively close to each other according to their natural ordering.

			11) The java.util.TreeMap class was introduced in Java 1.2 version of Java, available in all subsequent versions of the 
			    Java Development Kit (JDK), which was released in 1998. 
			    You can see the following link ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping ) on Wikipedia that was "Hard disk space 
			    usage visualized in TreeSize (see the image of Tree_Map.png)", software first released in 1996.

- Description:  
	
		Introduction of this lesson:

		The code provided demonstrates the usage of a HashMap to associate Student objects with their corresponding Exam objects. 

		It then converts the HashMap into a Map that maps student names to their exam scores using Java 8 streams and collectors.

			1) API of "public static <T, K, U> Collector<T, ?, Map<K,U>> toMap(Function<? super T, ? extends K> keyMapper, Function<? super T, ? extends 
			   U> valueMapper)"

				public final class Collectors {

				     * Returns a {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into a
				     * {@code Map} whose keys and values are the result of applying the provided
				     * mapping functions to the input elements.
				     *
				     * <p>If the mapped keys contain duplicates (according to
				     * {@link Object#equals(Object)}), an {@code IllegalStateException} is
				     * thrown when the collection operation is performed.  If the mapped keys
				     * might have duplicates, use {@link #toMap(Function, Function, BinaryOperator)}
				     * instead.
				     *
				     * <p>There are no guarantees on the type, mutability, serializability,
				     * or thread-safety of the {@code Map} returned.
				     *
				     * @apiNote
				     * It is common for either the key or the value to be the input elements.
				     * In this case, the utility method
				     * {@link java.util.function.Function#identity()} may be helpful.
				     * For example, the following produces a {@code Map} mapping
				     * students to their grade point average:
				     * <pre>{@code
				     * Map<Student, Double> studentToGPA
				     *   = students.stream().collect(
				     *     toMap(Function.identity(),
				     *           student -> computeGPA(student)));
				     * }</pre>
				     * And the following produces a {@code Map} mapping a unique identifier to
				     * students:
				     * <pre>{@code
				     * Map<String, Student> studentIdToStudent
				     *   = students.stream().collect(
				     *     toMap(Student::getId,
				     *           Function.identity()));
				     * }</pre>
				     *
				     * @implNote
				     * The returned {@code Collector} is not concurrent.  For parallel stream
				     * pipelines, the {@code combiner} function operates by merging the keys
				     * from one map into another, which can be an expensive operation.  If it is
				     * not required that results are inserted into the {@code Map} in encounter
				     * order, using {@link #toConcurrentMap(Function, Function)}
				     * may offer better parallel performance.
				     *
				     * @param <T> the type of the input elements
				     * @param <K> the output type of the key mapping function
				     * @param <U> the output type of the value mapping function
				     * @param keyMapper a mapping function to produce keys
				     * @param valueMapper a mapping function to produce values
				     * @return a {@code Collector} which collects elements into a {@code Map}

		It has getters and setters for these properties, as well as overridden hashCode, equals, and toString methods.


> ArraysAsListDemo.java
- Description:  
		
		Introduction of API - Arrays.asList:

		The Arrays.asList() method in Java is used to convert an array to a fixed-size List object. 
		This method is part of the java.util.Arrays class.

		When you use Arrays.asList() to convert an array to a List, the resulting List is a view of the original array. 
		This means that any modifications made to the List will be reflected in the original array and vice versa. 
		It provides a convenient way to work with arrays using the functionality provided by the List interface.

		However, there are a few important points to note:

			1) The returned List is of fixed size, which means you cannot add or remove elements from the List. 
			   If you attempt to do so by calling methods like add(), remove(), or clear() on the List, 
			   JVM (Java Virtual Machine) will throw an UnsupportedOperationException.


			2) Although you cannot change the size of the List, you can modify individual elements of the array through the List view. 
			   Changes made to a single element of the List will be reflected in the original array.


		It's important to understand these limitations when using Arrays.asList(), especially if you need to modify the size or structure of the collection.

> EfficiencyLab4Map.java
- Description: 

		The provided code measures the efficiency of different map implementations (TreeMap, HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and EnumMap) 

		by performing data operations and calculating the average duration for each implementation. 

		The map implementations are ranked based on their average duration, with the most efficient implementation at the top.

		Of the console, the EnumMap is the fastest in this particular code execution because it is specifically designed to work with enums as keys.

		Here are a few reasons why EnumMap performs well in this scenario:

			1) Memory Efficiency: 
			   EnumMap internally uses an array to store the values, where the index corresponds to the ordinal value of the enum constant. Since enum 
			   constants have a fixed and sequential range of values, EnumMap can efficiently utilize the memory by allocating an array of the 
			   appropriate size.

			2) Efficient Lookup: 
			   As the keys are enums, EnumMap takes advantage of the ordinal values of the enum constants to perform quick lookups. The ordinal values 
			   provide direct access to the corresponding array index, allowing for constant-time retrieval.

			3) Compact Data Structure: 
			   EnumMap is designed to work specifically with enums, which are finite and known at compile-time. This knowledge allows EnumMap to optimize 
			   the data structure for efficient storage and retrieval.

			4) Type Safety:  
			   EnumMap provides type safety guarantees at compile-time. It enforces that only keys of the specified enum type can be used, preventing 
			   accidental key-value associations with incompatible types.

		These factors contribute to the efficiency of EnumMap in this code example compared to other map implementations. However, it's important to note 
		that performance can vary depending on the specific use case and the operations performed. It's always recommended to benchmark and test different 
		implementations to determine the best choice for your specific requirements.

> TestConnection4MySQL.jaba
- Description: 

		1. Establish JDBC Driver, e,g., Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"):  

			Starting from JDBC 4.0, the driver manager can automatically detect and load the appropriate JDBC driver for your application without 
			the need to explicitly call Class.forName().

			In earlier versions of JDBC 4.0, "Class.forName()" was required to load the JDBC driver class and register it with the DriverManager. 				

			However, this was not necessary with JDBC 4.0 and later versions. 
			Instead, the driver class can be automatically located and loaded based on the contents of the META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver file in the 
			driver's JAR file.

			This feature is known as "automatic driver loading" and provides a more convenient way to manage JDBC drivers in your application. 
			It allows your application to automatically discover and use the appropriate JDBC driver, without having to worry about explicitly loading 
			and registering it.

			Regarding the info above, please visit the following link "https://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.8.3.0/ref/rrefjdbc4_0summary.html"

		2. META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver:

			The META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver file is a file that is included in the JAR file of a JDBC driver. 
			This file contains the name of the driver class that implements the java.sql.Driver interface, which is used by the Java DriverManager to 
			automatically discover and load the driver at runtime.

			The format of the META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver file is simple. It consists of one line that contains the fully qualified name of the 
			driver class that implements the java.sql.Driver interface. 
			For example, the contents of the file might look like this:

				com.example.jdbc.Driver

			When the DriverManager is asked to establish a connection to a database, it scans the classpath for JAR files that contain the META-
			INF/services/java.sql.Driver file. 
			If it finds a file with the correct name, it reads the name of the driver class from the file and loads that class using the current thread's 
			context class loader. Once the class is loaded, the DriverManager instantiates an instance of the driver and registers it with itself.

			This feature is useful because it allows JDBC drivers to be loaded and registered automatically, without requiring the application code to 
			explicitly load and register the driver using Class.forName().


		3. META-INF/services/com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver:

			The META-INF/services/com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver file is a file that is included in the JAR file of the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver. This 
			file contains the name of the driver class that implements the com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver interface, 
			which is used by the Java DriverManager to automatically discover and load the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver at runtime.

			The contents of the META-INF/services/com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver file in the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver JAR file is:

				com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

			When the DriverManager is asked to establish a connection to a MySQL database using the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver, it scans the classpath 
			for JAR files that contain the META-INF/services/com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver file. 
			If it finds a file with the correct name, it reads the name of the driver class (com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver) from the file and loads that class 
			using the current thread's context class loader. 
			Once the class is loaded, the DriverManager instantiates an instance of the driver and registers it with itself.

			This feature is useful because it allows the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver to be loaded and registered automatically, without requiring the 
			application code to explicitly load and register the driver using Class.forName().


		4. JDBC 4.0:

			JDBC 4.0 was introduced in Java SE 6 (JDK 1.6) and is also supported in later versions of Java, 
			including Java SE 7 (JDK 1.7), Java SE 8 (JDK 1.8), Java SE 9 (JDK 9), Java SE 10 (JDK 10), 
			Java SE 11 (JDK 11), Java SE 12 (JDK 12), Java SE 13 (JDK 13), Java SE 14 (JDK 14), 
			Java SE 15 (JDK 15), Java SE 16 (JDK 16), and Java SE 17 (JDK 17).

			Note that while JDBC 4.0 was introduced in Java SE 6, some JDBC drivers may not fully support all of the features introduced in JDBC 4.0. 
			It is always a good idea to check the documentation for your specific JDBC driver (i.e., Oracle, MSSQL, MySQL, Sysbase and etc...) 
			to see which JDBC version it supports and which features are available.


		5. Java Database Connectivity

			1) Register driver:		

					Before establishing a connection to a database, you need to load and register the appropriate JDBC driver. 
					This step informs the Java runtime environment about the driver class that will be used to connect to the database. 

					For example, with the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver, you would typically use 'Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver")' to 
					register the driver class.

			2) Get Connection:

					Once the driver is registered, you can use the 'DriverManager.getConnection()' method to establish a connection to the 
					database. 
					This method requires a database URL, username, and password as parameters. 

					The URL specifies the database's location and other connection details.

			3) Create Statement:

					After successfully connecting to the database, you can create a Statement object using the Connection.createStatement() 
					method. 
					The Statement object allows you to execute SQL statements and retrieve the results.

			4) Execute query:

					To retrieve data from the database, you can use the Statement.executeQuery() method to execute a SELECT statement. 

					This method returns a ResultSet object that represents the result set of the query. 

					You can then iterate over the result set to access the retrieved data.

			5) Execute update:

					The Statement.executeUpdate() method is used to execute SQL statements that modify data in the database. 

					It is typically used for statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and DDL (Data Definition Language) statements. 

					The method returns the number of rows affected by the update operation.

			6) Close connection:

					Once you have finished executing your queries and processing the results, 

					it is important to close the database resources to free up system resources and maintain proper database connections. 

					You should close the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects in reverse order of their creation. 

					For example, you can call the close() method on the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects.


		6. If you see the warning message of "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver", please follow the setting below:

Continue of DaemonThreadExample1.java, we updated the inheritance of Log.java from "extends to Thread" to "implements Runnable" <br>
Because only one super class could be extended to, what if we need to extend to any other class, respectively? We will do implement Runnable interface!  
 	
> In general speaking, we do encourage the use of Runnable over Thread: <br>

	1) While extending the Thread class, we're NOT overriding any of Thread's methods. However, we do override the method of Runnable (which Thread 
	conducts implementation of Runnable). 
	   
	This is a clear violation of IS-A Thread principle. For more detailed info of violation of IS-A Thread principle, please read the following 
	description: 
	   
	The "IS-A Thread" principle refers to the concept that a class that extends the Thread class is a type of thread, and should therefore be used 
	as a thread in the same way that the Thread class is used. 

	The principle of IS-A is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming, which states that a subclass should be able to be used 
	anywhere that its superclass is expected. 

	In the case of threading, if a class extends the Thread class, it should be able to be used in the same way that the Thread class is used. 

	However, when extending the Thread class, it is generally not recommended to override the Thread class's run() method directly. Instead, it is 
	recommended to implement the Runnable interface and pass an instance of the class to a Thread object's constructor. 

	This is because the Thread class provides other functionality besides just running a thread, such as managing thread states and handling thread 
	interruptions. 

	By implementing the Runnable interface and passing it to a Thread object, we can separate the code that will actually run in the thread from 
	the underlying thread management functionality provided by the Thread class. 

	So, while it is technically possible to override the Thread class's run() method when extending the Thread class, it is generally not 
	recommended and can be considered a violation of the IS-A Thread principle. 

	The preferred approach is to implement the Runnable interface and separate the thread management functionality from the code that runs in the 
	thread. 

	2) Beginning of Java 1.8, Runnable can be represented as lambda expressions

> SynchronizedCounter.java <br>
- Description:  
		
		A synchronized method is a method in Java that can only be accessed by one thread at a time. When a thread invokes a synchronized 
		method, it acquires the lock for that method, which prevents other threads from accessing the method until the lock is released. Here's 
		an example of a synchronized method:

		In this example, we create two threads thread1 and thread2 that increment the Counter object 1000 times each using the increment() 
		method. We start the threads using the start() method, which causes them to execute concurrently.

		We then use the join() method to wait for both threads to finish before printing the final count using the getCount() method. Because 
		the increment() method is synchronized, we can safely update the count from multiple threads without causing race conditions or other 
		concurrency issues.

		This example should output a final count of 20000 if the Counter class is implemented correctly.

> CyclicBarrierDemo.java and JointAccountWithCyclicBarrier.java
- Description:  
		
		CyclicBarrier is a synchronization aid in Java that allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a certain point of 
		execution before continuing.   
 	
		It is a barrier that all threads must wait at until all of them have reached that point, and then the barrier is released, and all 
		threads can continue executing.

		A CyclicBarrier is initialized with a fixed number of parties, which is the number of threads that need to reach the barrier. 

		As each thread arrives at the barrier, it calls the await() method, which causes it to wait until all other threads have also arrived 
		at the barrier. 

		Once all the threads have arrived, the barrier is released, and all threads can continue executing.	

		Application of CyclicBarrier:

			1) CyclicBarrier can be useful in situations where you have multiple threads that need to work in parallel on a particular task and need to synchronize their execution at certain points, and then wait for each other to complete before moving on to the next stage of processing.

			2) It is also useful in cases where you need to split a larger task into smaller sub-tasks and want to wait until all sub-tasks are completed before proceeding at a later stage.
	
> Transaction.java

		For a group of members to start a transaction, you can use a CyclicBarrier.
	
> CyclicBarrierImplThread.java
- Description:  

		This code demonstrates how to use the CyclicBarrier class to synchronize multiple threads in a concurrent program. 

> CyclicBarrierImplRunnable.java
- Description:  
	
		This implementation, it is similar to the one (i.e., CyclicBarrierImplThread.java) with threads, but uses Runnable tasks instead of 
		directly creating threads. 

> CyclicBarrierImplCallable.java
- Description:  
		
		This example is missing the code to submit the Callable tasks to a thread pool for execution, that's why the console you see it's 
		continually awaiting another 2 tasks to reach the barrier. 		

		In the current implementation, the tasks are being executed sequentially in the main thread, which is why you see the console-lines 
		"main is doing some work" and "main is waiting at the barrier" instead of the messages from the Worker tasks. 	

		To execute the tasks in parallel using a thread pool, you can use a ExecutorService to submit the tasks and wait for their completion 
		using Future objects. 	
		
		Please refer to the sample code of "CyclicBarrierImplCallableWithThreadPool.java" 

> CyclicBarrierImplCallableWithoutThreadPool.java
- Description:  
		
		
		This approach creates a new thread for each task and is NOT very efficient, especially if we need to execute a large number of tasks. 
		
		A better approach is to use a thread pool, which can manage a group of threads and reuse them to execute multiple tasks.
		
		Please refer to CyclicBarrierImplCallableWithThreadPool.java and CyclicBarrierImplCallableWithThreadPool2.java for a better approach.


> CyclicBarrierImplCallableWithThreadPool.java
- Description:  Using an ExecutorService with a thread pool is a good approach to manage the execution of multiple Callable tasks efficiently.


> CyclicBarrierImplCallableWithThreadPool2.java
- Description:  In this sample code, we create a thread pool with 3 threads using the Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3) method.

> Summaries:

		CyclicBarrier is a useful tool for synchronizing threads and coordinating their execution. The implementation of CyclicBarrier can be 
		done using Thread, Runnable, or Callable. 

		It may not be suitable for simple tasks where no return value is needed.
		Overall, the choice of implementation (Thread, Runnable, or Callable) depends on the complexity of the task and whether a return value 
		is needed. For simple tasks, the Thread or Runnable approach may be sufficient, while for more complex tasks that require a result, the 
		Callable approach is recommended. It is also important to consider the efficiency of thread management and resource usage, in which 
		case submitting tasks to an ExecutorService is recommended.

		Here are the pros and cons of each approach:

		ScheduledExecutorService is an interface in the Java programming language that provides a way to schedule tasks to be executed at a 
		specified time or with a fixed delay. It is part of the java.util.concurrent package and is commonly used in multi-threaded applications 
		where tasks need to be executed periodically or at a specific time.


		The ScheduledExecutorService interface provides methods for scheduling tasks to be executed, such as schedule(), scheduleAtFixedRate(), 
		and scheduleWithFixedDelay(). These methods take a Runnable or Callable object as a parameter and specify the time or delay at which the 
		task should be executed. The ScheduledExecutorService manages the execution of these tasks in a background thread, allowing the 
		application to continue running without interruption.


		ScheduledFuture is an interface that represents a delayed result of a scheduled task. When a task is scheduled using the 
		ScheduledExecutorService, a ScheduledFuture object is returned that can be used to check the status of the task, cancel the task, or 
		retrieve the result of the task once it has completed. The ScheduledFuture interface extends the Future interface, which is used to 
		represent the result of an asynchronous computation.


		Using the ScheduledExecutorService and ScheduledFuture interfaces, developers can easily schedule tasks to be executed at a specific 
		time or with a fixed delay, and manage the execution of those tasks in a background thread. This makes it easier to write efficient and 
		responsive multi-threaded applications that can perform tasks at specific intervals or times.

- Description:
	
		Introduction of this sample code:
 	
 		This NewSingleThreadScheduledExecutorDemo class demonstrates the use of the ScheduledExecutorService interface to schedule tasks for 
		
		execution. 
 	
 		It creates a new instance of ScheduledExecutorService using the newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor() method of the Executors class, 
 	
 		which returns a single-threaded executor. 
 	
 		It then schedules three tasks to run after a delay of one second each using the schedule() method of the ScheduledExecutorService

		The NewSingleThreadScheduledExecutorDemo2 class demonstrates the use of a ScheduledExecutorService instance that executes two tasks:

	 	ScheduledExecutorService is a Java interface that provides methods to schedule the execution of tasks at a specified time or with a

			scheduledFuture4LotteryTask2.get(); // wait for Lottery2 to complete
			System.out.println("Lottery2 task completed time: " + new Date());

 		This is because scheduledFuture4LotteryTask2.get() will block the thread until the task is complete, but the task is scheduled to run 
		
		indefinitely every second using scheduleAtFixedRate(). Therefore, scheduledFuture4LotteryTask2.get() will never complete, and the 
		
		subsequent code to print the completion time and shutdown the executor service will never execute.

- Description:
		
		1. This code implements a thread pool using the ThreadPoolExecutor class in Java. 
	   The program creates a thread pool using the Executors.newCachedThreadPool() method, 
	   which creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed and reuses previously constructed threads when they are available.
	
		2. The program then submits 5 tasks to the thread pool, alternating between Task1 and Task2. 
	   Each task simulates some work by sleeping for a random amount of time between 1 and 5 seconds using TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(new Random().nextInt(5) + 1).
	
		3. After all tasks have been submitted, the program initiates a graceful shutdown of the thread pool using executors.shutdown(). 
	   The program then waits for 5 seconds for all tasks to be completed using executors.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS). 
	   If any threads inside the thread pool are not executed completely, the program outputs the thread name that is awaiting for remaining thread(s) being executed. 
	   Otherwise, the program prints out "All tasks were executed and completed, so Pool thread was closed!".
	   
		4. The Task1 and Task2 classes implement the Runnable interface, which allows them to be executed in a thread pool. 
	   Each task simulates some work by sleeping for a random amount of time between 1 and 5 seconds using TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(new Random().nextInt(5) + 1). 
	   When the task is executed, it outputs a message to the console indicating that it has been assigned to the thread pool and another message indicating that it has been executed.

- Description:
	
		This is a Java code example that demonstrates the use of the ExecutorService.invokeAll() and ExecutorService.invokeAny() methods.
 	
		invokeAll() and invokeAny() are both methods of the ExecutorService interface in Java, which allow you to submit a collection of tasks 
		to a thread pool for execution. 	
	
		The main difference between the two methods is in their return types and behavior:
 	
	 	
			invokeAll():
	 			 		
				1) invokeAll() takes a collection of Callable tasks, and returns a list of Future objects. 
	 			 		
					The Future objects can be used to retrieve the result of each task after it has completed.
	 		   
					i.e., invokeAll() submits all tasks for execution and waits for all of them to complete.
	 	 		 	 	

			invokeAny():
	 	  	 	  	
				1) invokeAny() also takes a collection of Callable tasks, but it returns the result of the first task that completes 
				   successfully. 
	 	  	
				   It does not return a Future object for each task.
	
		
		Overall, this code demonstrates how to submit multiple tasks to a thread pool using the invokeAll method and obtain their results, 
		
		as well as how to obtain the result of the first completed task using the invokeAny method.

		Introduction of Fork/Join framework:
	
			The Fork/Join framework is a Java concurrency mechanism that enables the parallel execution of tasks in a recursive divide-and-
			conquer approach. 
		
			It is designed to efficiently handle workloads that can be broken down into smaller, independent pieces that can be processed in 
			parallel.
		
			One of the key benefits of the Fork/Join framework is that it can take advantage of multiple processors and cores, 	
			which can significantly improve the performance of parallelizable algorithms. 
		
			Additionally, the framework automatically balances the workload among the available threads, ensuring that each thread is 
			working on a comparable amount of work.
 		
	 		Overall, the Fork/Join framework is a powerful tool for writing efficient, parallelizable code in Java.
 		
 		
			The Fork/Join framework consists of two main components: 

				1) ForkJoinPool 

						The ForkJoinPool is a thread pool that manages the execution of ForkJoinTasks.

				2) ForkJoinTask

						The ForkJoinTask is an abstract class that represents a task that can be divided into smaller subtasks. 

						When a ForkJoinTask is executed, it may split itself into multiple subtasks, which are then executed in 
						parallel by the threads in the ForkJoinPool.

		 Introduction of Fibonacci:
	 	
			1) Fibonacci can be used as an example problem for demonstrating different programming concepts and techniques.

			   For example, the Fibonacci sequence can be used to demonstrate recursion, dynamic programming, and parallel programming. 

			2) Implementing the Fibonacci sequence can be a good exercise for beginner programmers to learn these concepts.

			3) Note that for larger values of THRESHOLD, the recursive algorithm can be very slow and may cause a stack overflow error. 

			   In practice, it is often better to use an iterative algorithm or a more efficient algorithm, such as dynamic programming, to 
			   
			   compute large Fibonacci numbers.

			4) Also, the Fibonacci sequence is often used as an example of a problem that can be solved using the fork/join framework.

			   The ForkJoinTask class provides a way to divide a task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel on multiple 
			
			   processors.

- Description:
		
 		
 		The code is an implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using the fork/join framework in Java. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of 
		numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
	

		The class FibonacciForkJoinWithForkJoinPool extends the RecursiveTask class, which represents a task that can be split into smaller 
		subtasks and executed asynchronously in separate threads. 

		Also, the class FibonacciForkJoinWithForkJoinPool allows for more control over the number of threads used.

		In Summary of both of the FibonacciForkJoinWithInvokeAll and FibonacciForkJoinWithForkJoinPool classes:

			1) Both of classes use the fork/join framework to compute the nth Fibonacci number recursively in parallel. 

			   However, they differ in the way the subtasks are executed and the number of threads used.

			2) FibonacciForkJoinWithInvokeAll:

			   Use the invokeAll() method to execute the subtasks asynchronously in separate threads. 

			   The two subtasks are created and added to a list, which is then passed to the invokeAll() method. 

			   The invokeAll() method returns when all the subtasks are complete, and the results are obtained using the join() method.

			3) FibonacciForkJoinWithForkJoinPool:

			   Use the ForkJoinPool class to execute the subtasks. The ForkJoinPool class is instantiated with the desired number of 
			   threads, and the invoke() method is called on the main task to execute the computation. 

			   The invoke() method returns the result of the computation, which is obtained using the join() method.

			   FibonacciForkJoinWithForkJoinPool also has a maximum number of threads limit. The number of threads created is based on the 
			   number of processors available and also the maximum limit set as MAXIMUM_NUMBER_THREADS.

			   The ForkJoinPool will create threads up to this limit, and if there are more subtasks than threads available, some of the 
			   subtasks will have to wait for a thread to become available before they can be executed.

> UniqueTemporaryFileCreated.java
- Description: 
	
	
	
		This Java program creates a temporary file using the createTempFile() method of the File class.
 		
		Overall, this program demonstrates how to create a temporary file using the createTempFile() method of the File class, and how to check 
		
		whether the file was successfully created and deleted.
	

> FixedTemporaryFileCreated.java
- Description: 
	
	
		Continue the previously lesson: 
 	
 		We used tempFile.createNewFile() instead of File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix, directoryOfTemp) is that 
 		
 		it allows us to specify the exact name of the temporary file that we want to create.
 		
		When we use File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix, directoryOfTemp), a unique file name is generated automatically, 
 		
 		which can be useful in preventing naming conflicts. 
 		
 		However, if we want to create a temporary file with a specific name or a specific naming convention, 
 		
 		we can use tempFile.createNewFile() instead.

> FileWriterDemo.java
- Description: 
	
		This Java program generates a file named "lottery.txt" in the "data" subdirectory of the directory path specified in the "root" variable. 
 	
	 	The file contains 10 lines of lottery numbers, with each line having 6 unique numbers between 1 and 42.
	
	
> FileReaderDemo.java
- Description: 
	
		This program demonstrates how to use the FileReader class in Java to read the contents of a file character by character.  
 	
 		The program prompts the user to choose between two options: displaying all the data in the file on one line or showing each line 
		
		separately.
	
	


> AnalyzeLotteryNumbers.java
- Description: 

		
		This program analyzes lottery numbers by counting the occurrences of each number in the given input data. 
 	
 		The input data is a string that represents a list of numbers separated by commas and spaces. 
 	
 		The program splits the string into an array of individual number strings, creates a linked hash map with 
		
		keys as the numbers from 1 to 42 and values as 0, 
 	
		and then iterates through the array to increment the value of each corresponding key in the map.
 	
	

	
> CopyContent.java
- Description: 

		
		This Java program reads the content of a file named "lottery.txt" located in the subdirectory "data"  

		and creates a copy of its content in a new file named "lottery_Copy.txt" located in the same directory. 

		The program uses FileReader and FileWriter classes to read and write the file content, respectively.
 	

		
> DownloadImage.java
- Description: 

		
		This Java program downloads an image from a URL and saves it to a specified location on the local filesystem.
 	
	

> DownloadImage4LargerSize.java
- Description: 

		
		To make the code more efficient for downloading larger files, 
 		
 		you can increase the size of the byte buffer used to read and write the data. 
 		
 		Instead of reading and writing one byte at a time, you can read and write a larger chunk of data at once.
 		
 		In this updated version of the code, we use a buffer of 4096 bytes (4KB) to read and write the data. 
 		
 		This should be more efficient than reading and writing one byte at a time.
 		
 		Additionally, we use the read method of the input stream to read as much data as possible into the buffer, 
 		
 		and we use the write method of the output stream to write the entire buffer to the file.

		This updated code will be more efficient for downloading larger files. 
		
		However, it's still important to note that downloading very large files can take a long time, 
		
		and there may be network limitations or other factors that could impact the download speed.

- Description: 	
	
	
		The provided code is an example of using a BufferedWriter to write data to a file. 
 	
		It creates a BufferedWriter object that wraps around a FileWriter object to write text to a file.

		In this code, the BufferedWriter object is created by passing a FileWriter object to its constructor. 

		The FileWriter object is used to specify the file path and to allow for appending data to the file. 

		The write() method of the BufferedWriter object is used to write the text to the file, 

		and the close() method is automatically called when the try block is exited.

> CopyFileWithInputStream.java
- Description: 
	
	
		This Java program downloads an image from a URL and saves it to a local file using the Java NIO Files class.
	
	
		
> CopyFileEnhancedEfficiency.java
- Description: 
	
	
		This Java program demonstrates four different options to copying a file from a URL to a local destination file, and measures the 
		elapsed time for each option. 
 	
 			1) The program first defines a URL string url pointing to an image file, and creates a URI object uri from the url string. 
 	
	 		2) The program also specifies the path to the destination file where the image will be saved using a Path object destination.
	
			3) The program performs four different options to copying the image file to the destination file:
	
		 	   For each option, the program records the start and end times of the copying process using System.nanoTime(), and calculates 	
			   the elapsed time in milliseconds. 
			
			   The program then prints the elapsed time for each option.
	
				Option 1:
				 	
					Use a BufferedInputStream to copy the file in a single thread.
				
				Option 2:
					
					Use a BufferedInputStream, but with a larger buffer size than option 1.
				
				Option 3:
				 	
				 	Use multiple threads to copy the file. The program uses an ExecutorService to create a thread pool with four 
					threads, and submits a DownloadTask to the thread pool, which downloads the file and returns the Path of the 
					downloaded file. 
				 	
				 	The program then retrieves the downloaded Path from the Future object returned by the submit method.
				 			 	
				 	
				 	DownloadTask class:
				
						The program also defines a nested class DownloadTask, which implements the Callable interface, 
						
						and is used for option 3 to download the file using a separate thread. 
						
						The DownloadTask takes a URI object and a Path object as its constructor arguments, and downloads the 
						
						file using a BufferedInputStream, and saves the file to the specified destination file. The 
						
						DownloadTask returns the Path of the downloaded file.
				
				Option 4:
				 	
				 	Cache the downloaded file, so that if the destination file already exists, the file is not downloaded again.
		
	

	
			
> FilesWriteAndReadString.java
- Description: 
	
	
		 	This Java program demonstrates how to use the java.nio.file.Files class to write a string to a file and then read the same 
			file.
	
			The java.nio.file.Files class in Java 11, introduced the new writeString and readString methods for writing and reading a 
			string to/from a file, respectively.

			Both methods throw an IOException if an error occurs while accessing the file.

				1) The writeString method creates a new file at the specified path using the Files.createFile(path) method, and then 
				   writes the provided string to the file using the CharSequence argument. 

				   The StandardOpenOption.WRITE option is used to open the file for writing.

				2) The readString method reads the contents of the file at the specified path as a string and returns the result.


> FileWalkDemo.java
- Description: 
	
	
			This Java program demonstrates how to use the Files.walk() method to recursively traverse a directory tree and process each 
			file in the tree. 

			The program looks for files with a .txt extension, prints their absolute paths, creation time, and size, and increments a 
			counter to keep track of the number of .txt files processed.

			Overall, this program provides a simple example of how to use the Files.walk() method to recursively traverse a directory tree
			and process each file in the tree. 

			It demonstrates how to filter files based on their extension and how to access their attributes such as creation time and size.

# day22 Java RSA v.s. ECDSA:

> SecurityLevelSimulation.java
- Description:

To verify the security level of SHA256withRSA and SHA256withECDSA at the same level, it’s important to understand the underlying mathematical assumptions and key lengths that provide the security guarantees. Here’s an outline:
1. Security Level of RSA vs. ECDSA:
•	RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. The security strength increases with key size.
o	RSA-2048 provides roughly 112 bits of security.
o	RSA-3072 provides roughly 128 bits of security (equivalent to AES-128).
•	ECDSA relies on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP), which is harder to break than RSA at smaller key sizes.
o	ECDSA-256 (secp256r1 curve) provides roughly 128 bits of security (similar to RSA-3072).
2. Security Simulation:
While directly simulating the cryptographic "security" (i.e., breaking the encryption or signature algorithm) in Java is impractical due to the complexity and computational resources required (factorization and solving discrete logarithms are not feasible with ordinary computing power), you can perform simulations that stress-test the implementation under various conditions to understand if they behave correctly and maintain their integrity.
Here are two ways to proceed:
1.	Stress Testing the signature and verification process with different key sizes and large amounts of data.
2.	Test Against Known Attacks: Use built-in libraries and frameworks to ensure the algorithms are resistant to common cryptographic attacks (like chosen-ciphertext attacks).
3. Java Simulation to Compare Security Features
While you cannot directly "break" either algorithm, you can simulate cryptographic integrity by:
1.	Generating and verifying a large number of signatures to ensure no vulnerabilities or flaws in the cryptographic implementation (this ensures the practical security of the system).
2.	Testing different key sizes to observe how long it takes for the algorithm to handle encryption/decryption or signing/verifying under various loads.

Key Features:
•	Key Sizes for RSA: 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits.
•	Curves for ECDSA: secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1.
•	Signing and Verification: Measures the time taken for signing and verifying messages for each algorithm and key size.
4. How to Verify the Security Level:
1.	Check Key Size Equivalence: Use equivalent key sizes for RSA and ECDSA for a fair comparison:
o	RSA-2048 is comparable to ECDSA-256 (secp256r1) in terms of security level.
o	RSA-3072 is comparable to ECDSA-384 (secp384r1).
2.	Stress Test: This simulation runs through various key sizes to observe their performance and reliability under typical use cases (signing and verification).
5. Simulation Results Interpretation:
•	Execution Time: Larger key sizes (e.g., RSA-4096) will have longer execution times, indicating more computational effort but potentially higher security.
•	Verification Time: Typically, ECDSA is faster than RSA for equivalent security levels, even at higher elliptic curve sizes (521-bit vs 4096-bit RSA).
Security is ultimately about:
•	Key length (for RSA) and curve strength (for ECDSA).
•	Mathematical hardness of the underlying problems (factoring for RSA, discrete logarithms for ECDSA).
•	Protection against quantum computing (both RSA and ECDSA are vulnerable but will require post-quantum algorithms in the future).
This simulation tests the correctness, performance, and practical security aspects of these algorithms rather than the theoretical cryptographic hardness (which requires large-scale factorization or discrete logarithm problem-solving, not possible with normal computation).
