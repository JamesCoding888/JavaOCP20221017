The performance of a hash map is affected by two parameters: Initial Capacity and Load Factor. 
The capacity is the number of buckets or the underlying array length and the initial capacity is simply the capacity during creation.

The load factor (LF), is a measure of how full the hash map should be after adding some values before it is resized.

default initial capacity of HashSet: 16
default load factor of HashSet: 0.75


Let's resized the initial capacity to be 100 as following example:
1) 100 * 75% = 75 (Threshold)
   That is, while the 75th entry (i.e., key-value-pair) is added, hashSet will increase the capacity from 100 to 200.  
2) 200 * 75% = 150 (Threshold)
   While adding the 150th entry, hash map will increase the capacity from 200 to 300.
   
   							      			
											      			
Index lookup costs:
The database server incurs additional costs when it finds a row through an index. 
The index is stored on disk, and its pages must be read into memory with the data pages that contain the desired rows.

An index lookup works down from the root page to a leaf page. 
The root page, because it is used so often, is almost always found in a page buffer. 
The odds of finding a leaf page in a buffer depend on the size of the index, the form of the query, and the frequency of column-value duplication. 
If each value occurs only once in the index and the query is a join, each row to be joined requires a non-sequential lookup into the index, followed by a non-sequential access to the associated row in the table.
