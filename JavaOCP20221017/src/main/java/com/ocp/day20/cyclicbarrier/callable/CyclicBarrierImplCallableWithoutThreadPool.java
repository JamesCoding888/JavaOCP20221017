/*
 	
	Here is an example of how you can modify the main method of CyclicBarrierImplCallable class:
	
	This example does NOT use a thread pool explicitly. 
	
	Instead, we create 3 new threads explicitly using the new Thread(task).start() method to submit each FutureTask to a new thread for execution.  
	
	
	
	Notice:
	
		This approach creates a new thread for each task and is NOT very efficient, especially if we need to execute a large number of tasks. 
		
		A better approach is to use a thread pool, which can manage a group of threads and reuse them to execute multiple tasks.
		
		Please refer to CyclicBarrierImplCallableWithThreadPool.java and CyclicBarrierImplCallableWithThreadPool2.java for a better approach.
