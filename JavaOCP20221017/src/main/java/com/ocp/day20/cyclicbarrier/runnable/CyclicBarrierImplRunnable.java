/* 
 	In this example, we have 5 threads executing concurrently.   
 	
 	Each thread will print a message indicating that it is working, and then wait for all other threads to reach the barrier. 
 	
 	Once all threads have reached the barrier, the barrier will "break" and all threads will continue executing. 
 	
 	Each thread will then print another message indicating that it is done.
 	
 	Overall of this implementation, it is similar to the one with threads, but uses Runnable tasks instead of directly creating threads.
 	
 	
 	Notice:
 		
 		The order in which the threads complete may vary from run to run, so the actual console may differ from below. 
 	
 		However, the pattern should be the same: all threads should complete their work, and the barrier should ensure that they all reach the synchronization point before continuing.
