/*
 	CyclicBarrier is a synchronization aid in Java that allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a certain point of execution before continuing. 
 	
 	It is a barrier that all threads must wait at until all of them have reached that point, and then the barrier is released, and all threads can continue executing.

	A CyclicBarrier is initialized with a fixed number of parties, which is the number of threads that need to reach the barrier. 
	
	As each thread arrives at the barrier, it calls the await() method, which causes it to wait until all other threads have also arrived at the barrier. 
	
	Once all the threads have arrived, the barrier is released, and all threads can continue executing.

	
	Application of CyclicBarrier:

		1) CyclicBarrier can be useful in situations where a group of threads need to work together on a particular task and need to synchronize their execution at certain points. 
	
		2) It is also useful in cases where you need to split a larger task into smaller sub-tasks and want to wait until all sub-tasks are completed before proceeding.
