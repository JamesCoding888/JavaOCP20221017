/*
 	Explanation of programs as following:
	
	The Lottery class implements Callable<Set<Integer>> which means that it can be used as a task that returns a set of integers and may throw an exception.
    
    The Lottery class contains a method call() which is called when the Lottery object is executed as a task. 
	
	The main method in the LotteryMain class creates a FutureTask object using the Lottery object and starts a new thread to execute the task. 
	
	The main thread waits for the result of the FutureTask by calling the get() method. 
	
	If the task throws an InterruptedException or an ExecutionException, they are caught and their stack traces are printed.

	When the Lottery task is executed, it generates a set of 6 random integers and returns them as the result of the task. 
	
	Finally, the main thread prints the result of the task, which is the set of 6 random integers.
