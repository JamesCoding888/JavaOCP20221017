/*
 	1. A daemon thread is a type of thread in a computer program that runs in the background and provides a supporting service to other threads or processes. 
 	   Unlike user threads, daemon threads do NOT prevent the program from exiting when the main thread finishes execution.
 	
 			E.g., call the setDaemon(true) method after stating of the thread, the method of "public final void setDaemon(boolean on) {...}" will throw IllegalThreadStateException.
 		
 	2. In other words, a daemon thread is a type of thread that runs in the background, without being tied to the lifetime of the application or the process. 
 	   Daemon threads are typically used to perform tasks that do not require direct interaction with the user, such as monitoring resources or performing maintenance tasks.

	3. One common example of a daemon thread (low-priority thread) is the garbage collector (GC) in Java. The garbage collector is a daemon thread that runs in the background, 
	   automatically freeing up memory that is NO longer being used by the program.
 	
 	4. In summary, daemon threads are used to perform tasks that need to run continuously in the background, without being tied to the lifetime of the program. 
 	   They are designed to provide supporting services to other threads and processes without interfering with their execution.
