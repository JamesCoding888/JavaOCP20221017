/*
 	Of this lesson, we create a daemon thread that runs an infinite loop, printing a message every second. 
 	We set the daemon flag to true which is likely calling method of setDaemon(true) to mark the thread as a daemon thread.

	In the main thread, we print a message and sleep for 5 seconds before printing another message. 
	Because the daemon thread is running in the background and does not block the main thread, the program will exit after the main thread finishes execution, 
	even though the daemon thread is still running.
	
	For the specifically operation of Daemon thread, please refer to the DaemonThreadExample2.java
