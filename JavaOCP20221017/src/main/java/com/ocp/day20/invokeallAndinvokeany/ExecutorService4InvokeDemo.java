/*
 	This is a Java code example that demonstrates the use of the ExecutorService.invokeAll() and ExecutorService.invokeAny() methods.
 	
 	invokeAll() and invokeAny() are both methods of the ExecutorService interface in Java, which allow you to submit a collection of tasks to a thread pool for execution.
 	
 	The main difference between the two methods is in their return types and behavior:
 	
	 	invokeAll():
	 		
	 		1) invokeAll() takes a collection of Callable tasks, and returns a list of Future objects. 
	 		
	 		   The Future objects can be used to retrieve the result of each task after it has completed.
	 		   
	 		   i.e., invokeAll() submits all tasks for execution and waits for all of them to complete.
	 	 		 	 	
	 	invokeAny():
	 	  
	 	  	1) invokeAny() also takes a collection of Callable tasks, but it returns the result of the first task that completes successfully. 
	 	  	
	 	  	   It does not return a Future object for each task.
	
	
	
	Overall, this code demonstrates how to submit multiple tasks to a thread pool using the invokeAll method and obtain their results, 
	
	as well as how to obtain the result of the first completed task using the invokeAny method.
