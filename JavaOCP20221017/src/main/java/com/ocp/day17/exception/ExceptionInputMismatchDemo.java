	What is advantage of using try/catch block?  
		
		1. Using one try/catch instead of multiple if statements
		2.
		
		
	What is disadvantage of using try/catch block?
		
		1. Throwing and catching an exception is an expensive operation compared with most any other primitive operation.
		
		
	What is advantage of using if/else condition:
		
		1. If developer expects the exceptions to be thrown relatively often, developer will be better off with using an if/else for a better performance.
	
	
	Concept of using try-catch block:

		1. The purpose of a try-catch block is to catch and handle an exception generated by working code. 
		   Some exceptions can be handled in a catch block and the problem solved without the exception being rethrown; 
		   however, more often the only thing that you can do is make sure that the appropriate exception is thrown.
		
		2. When the normal path through the code should proceed without error unless there are truly some exceptional conditions
		   E.g., 
		   		-	the server being down
		   		-	credentials being expired or incorrect 	 
		
		3. Developer will probably want to check that the contents of result are what developer expects with control flow logic 
		   rather than just attempting to use data that may NOT be valid for dedveloper's purpose.

	
	Concept of NOT using try-catch block:

		1. Unnecessarily use try-catch block to handle non-exceptional errors
		   E.g.,
		   		-	like the current user not being in the correct role 
		   		-	when developer can reasonably expect and handle an error that is NOT an exceptional condition, developer should do self-check
		
		2. Try/catch block SHALL NOT be used to protect yourself from bad programming
		
		3. Don’t catch fatal exceptions; nothing you can do about them anyway, and trying to generally makes it worse
	
		4. Fix your code so that your programming NEVER triggers a bone-headed exception
		   E.g.,
		   		-	an "IndexOutOfRangeException" should NEVER happen in production code. Developer shall fix it in the first place
