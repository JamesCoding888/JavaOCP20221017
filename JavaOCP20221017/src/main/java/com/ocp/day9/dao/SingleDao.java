/*
 	Introduction of how to create a Singleton Pattern as below
	To create a singleton-class, this class must implement the following properties:
	
	1) Create a private constructor of the class to restrict object created outside of the singleton-class.
	
	2) Create a private attribute (i.e., "private static SingleDao SingleDao_Instance = new SingleDao()") of the class type that refers to the single object.
	
	3) Create a public static method (i.e., "public static SingleDao getSingleDaoInstance()") that allows us to create and access the object we created. 
	   Inside the method, we will create a condition that prohibits us from creating more than one object.
	   
	   What's this mean by, regarding "allows us to create and access the object we created" ? 
	   It's likely you share a Single Global Instance and provide a Global Point of Access to SingleDao.class.

		this.id_number = new Random().nextInt(100_000_000); // Create a randomly number from 0 to 99_999_999
