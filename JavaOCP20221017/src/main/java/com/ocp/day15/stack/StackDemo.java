/*
	Introduction of Stack:
	
	1. public class Stack<E> extends Vector<E>	
	2. The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. 
	3. It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. 
	4. The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, 
	   a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
	
	   When a stack is first created, it contains no items.
	5. Since JDK 1.0
