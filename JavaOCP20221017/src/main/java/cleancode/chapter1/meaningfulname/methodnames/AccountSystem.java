/* 

	1. Consider that developer will read your code. Therefore, a better naming is to use:
		-	Computer Science Terms 
		-	Algorithm names
		-	Solution Domain Names
		-   Problem Domain Names 
		-	Pattern names 
		-	Math terms 
		-	and so on...
	
	2. It is NOT wise to draw every name from the problem domain because developer does NOT want their colleague to run back and forth 
	   while customer requesting what every name means when colleague already know the concept by a different name. Tedious Process !!!
	
	3. Donâ€™t Add Gratuitous Context as follows:
		
		 -	AccountSystem4EngineeringDepartmentsAndClient.class
		    Note: Developer shall think about if characters are redundant or irrelevant
	
 	
 	4. Final words: 	
	   	 -  The hardest thing in terms of choosing good names is that it requires good descriptive skills and a shared cultural background.
	     -  Don't be afraid of renaming if change the name is for better!
	     -  Most of time we don't remember the name of classes and methods, but developer does use modern tools to deal with details like 
	        that so developer can keep eye on whether the code reads like paragraphs and sentences, or like tables and data structure at least.
